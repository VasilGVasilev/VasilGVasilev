# 💫 Hi, I am Vasil:
<br>I am a Web Developer from Bulgaria, enthusiastic about Front-End development, but also have solid foundation in Back-End technologies.
<br>
<br>👉 About Me<br>
<br>💡 How can I develop a great software that customers would love? That's the question I ask myself every single time when I have to do а project, whether it's for university or for work. In each case it has come down to creativity and experience.<br>
<br>🎓 Prior to pursuing my true passion, web development, I have studied English and German law culminating in my Master of Laws degree with honours. I also have taken the Javascript Developer Path at SoftUni finishing each course with the highest note possible.<br>
<br>💻 As a developer I have delivered several projects for private clients. The latest being ![Ixora Luxury Residence]((https://ixorabg.com/)<br>
<br>👨‍💻 Also, I'm constantly updating my personal articles that reflect on the problems I have stumbled upon during my journey as a programmer.<br>
